            <h2>Ways to Give</h2>
            <p>Vehicle donations made to a charitable not-for-profit organization such as Ability Connection Oklahoma are tax deductible. The best practice is to consult with a tax professional on how to maximize your tax deduction since every car donation and tax situation is unique.</p>

            <p>In general, the IRS limits the tax deduction to the gross proceeds from the sale of the car, truck, or other vehicle. Charitable contributions must be itemized on Schedule A of Form 1040 to qualify. If the total deduction claimed on the tax return exceeds $500, Form 8283 "Noncash Charitable Contributions" must also be completed and attached.</p>
            <p>To learn more on what a donor&apos;s responsibilities are prior to making a car donation, please consult the "Donor&apos;s Guide to Vehicle Donations" found in IRS Publication 4303. The file may be read with Adobe Reader, which is available for free download by clicking here.</p>
