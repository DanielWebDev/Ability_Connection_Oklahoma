            <p>Giving the gift of tribute allows the expression of your  support, respect, gratitude or love through a gift, which enriches the lives of and improves the quality of life of  people with disabilities and their families.  Tribute gifts may be made in celebration of a special  event such as an anniversary or birthday, to honor the achievement of a business colleague or in memory of a  loved one or cherished friend.   When your tribute gift is received, a tribute card will be sent in your name to the individual you are honoring or the family of the person you are remembering. You will also receive an acknowledgement.
